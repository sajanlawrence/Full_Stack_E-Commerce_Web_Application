# Full Stack E-Commerce Web Application Project

This is my first Full Stack Web Application project. I have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for front end design and Flask( Python framework ) for back end . The database I used in this project is Postgresql and my object relational mapper is SQLAlchemy.
